Link to Kaggle Project: https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/overview

This is my submission for CSCA 5642 Week 3 Assignment. There are 3 elements to this project:
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. GitHub Repo (You are here)
3. Kaggle Submission Screenshot

Please view the Jupyter Notebook featured in this repo to review my work.

IMPORTANT: The data was far too large to host in a Git Repo so instead it can be found at the Kaggle link provided above.
